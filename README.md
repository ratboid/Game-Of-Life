Game-Of-Life
============

This is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton used in computer science. Further information about the rules of the game and history can be found at [Wikipedia][1]

Development
-----------
I did most of the coding of this in the fall of 2012. It is being uploaded to git now because some people requested that I put it onto the Internet to be looked at. The code is written in java using the awt libraries to run the graphics and keyboard commands. Most of it was coded by hand, except for the layouts in the viewer. For that, I used the Netbeans enviroment to generate the necessary code, which I added on to for functionality.
